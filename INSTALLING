1. get fins using one of the following methods:

   hg clone http://hg.welliver.org/fins
   git clone https://github.com/hww3/fins

2. set your FINS_HOME directory to the location of the cloned fins repo.

3. in the speedydelivery directory, copy config/dev_sample.cfg to 
   config/dev.cfg.

4. edit dev.cfg as approprite (note that the smtp settings will be
   configured using a web interface later.

5. create the schema using the following command:

   sqlite3 db/SpeedyDelivery_dev.sqlite3 < config/schema.sqlite

6. start up speedydelivery:

   bin/start.sh --no-virtual

7. when speedydelivery starts up the first time, you'll need to configure
   the smtp support. you can do this by going to the following url:

   http://localhost:8080/

8. you'll need to configure your SMTP server to deliver mail bound for 
   speedydelivery via smtp. if you've specified speedydelivery listen on port 
   2025, and you chose the return address of "lists.mydomain.com", something
   like the following would work for postfix (add this line to the transports
   configuration file):
   
   lists.mydomain.com      smtp:speedydeliveryhost.mydomain.com:2025

9. enjoy!
